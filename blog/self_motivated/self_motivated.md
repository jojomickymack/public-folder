# Self Motivated

I'm not much for 'advice' writing - I certainly don't have all the answers. Still, there's some concepts I'd like put down into my blog - it is MY blog after all and should reflect a wide range of my opinions.

It's probably a result of my having interviewed so many people - it's an interesting setting for evaluating what you virtues resonate with you as a person, and how you judge yourself at the end of the day. One theme that's emerged for me is the concept of having 'drive', and having some sense that you're 'destined to do something'. I'm putting quotes around these keywords because my understanding of them is vague.

I think this could be summed up in one idea - 'passion'. Some might call this a 'muse', an 'inspiration', or a 'cause' - a reason for making the effort. Put in base terms - a concept of 'righteousness' in your existence that helps you determine if something has value or not.

Has that 'passion' or 'cause' brought you to this interview, and is what this position entails serving that somehow? Is it part of your 'mission', or are you just here because of the 'job thing'?

I'm not trying to act high and mighty - I'm far from that, it's just that I want to play a role in enabling others to define their desire as I try to for mine. I am an idealist, certainly - I'm also a realist and I know that if I was to lose everything, I'd still have the same basic motivation. Are you self motivated? How can we work together to gain better control or our destinies?

## Duality

I strongly believe that it's part of the human condition to be conflicted - we have a right and left brain, after all. Sometimes it's difficult to suppress the constant chatter between the two halves of the brain, forever trying to win a debate with the other. A question without _context_... is an illusion. That's why we're an intelligent species - it's because of our mind's derisive nature that we can consider different perspectives - that an idea can evolve and expand.

There's a concept of absolutism in philosophy that I think resonates in business - pure positive or negative - black or white - right or wrong. It's unrealistic - you can only have an absolutist philosophy if you're suppressing context - attempting to manipulate it so it's simpler.

A component of self motivation is an understanding that you're not always right - a humble person would be thankful to _ever_ be right about _anything_, a pragmatic person would be satisfied to be right hopefully more often then wrong because they're _trying_. An athlete understands that pushing themselves to greater heights can lead to suffering and recovery, an artist understands that inspiration can lead to apathy, and a writer knows that fits of creativity can lead to writers block.

The point is that self motivation isn't absolute, it's a trade off. It's a game of hits and misses, and there's context to every idea and every action.

## You Need To Be Your Own Advocate

As a pragmatist, you've got to know that distance = speed multiplied by time. If you don't have any speed, it doesn't matter how much time passes - you're not getting any closer to your goal. You invest your time and energy into some form of work every day - if you aren't investing part of that total time and energy into your _self_ every day, you're static. You need to have some way of advancing your interest in some small way every day because then it's just a matter of time. You _will_ get somewhere.

You need to be the first one to stand up for yourself - I don't think that it's true that nobody else will advocate for you, but in order for you to succeed you have to be your own advocate. You need to be actively making plans for yourself and watching out for hazards. In business and in life, everyone needs to profit, and it's so easy to get subjugated completely by other people's plans for you. I'm not saying that you shouldn't ever compromise, but in every negotiation there's different interests. Be your own advocate and make sure your needs are met.

## Summary

This piece is my attempt at branching out my writing, it's probably a little headstrong because it's a first attempt. I think what I had in my head before starting is that if you put something in a piggy bank each day, it'll eventually be full one day. If you do a little writing every day - you'll end up becoming a great writer and you'll be admired by people who read your material. The same goes for if you try to do a sketch in an art book every day - that small frequent investment will turn into something.

For me, I'm actually trying to do both of those things, as well as a lot of other personal projects. I think about motivation and my own personal progress from time to time, and I hope this shred of my insight resonates with you somewhat.
